# Sweet Pink theme for Home Assistant

Theme for home assistant that makes use of pinks and purples and maybe even some teal. A few custom fonts, take them out if you want! (Uses Lato by default, and if not available Raileway or Roboto)

# HACS

You can install this via HACS and keep it up to date. I highly recommend going that route.

# Installation

Literally you can just grab the YAML file and put it in your themes folder. If you put it there via git, you can get upstream updates. If you install via HACS, you get them automatically. But it's just a little bit of CSS.

# Extensions

There's a lot of custom cards out there now that use their own classes and styles, PRs are welcome!

# Vibe

Hacker Elite meets Moog Synths meets Miami Vice tempered towards a masculine understanding of the feminine

Long overdue in Oct 2024 with a bunch of the new theme vars
